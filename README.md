# get_next_line

The aim of this 42 project is to code a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns the next line, without the newline character. The bonus part of this project involves reading from multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread.

The code relating to the bonus part is almost identical to the code from the mandatory part, the only exception being that the buffer string storing the characters read is two-dimensional in the bonus code (for storing characters read from multiple fd's) and one-dimensional in the standard code.
